# Summer Olympics Host Cities app

This year the latest installment of the [Summer Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games) are being held in Tokyo, Japan.  We will celebrate this occasion by building an app that displays information about cities that have hosted summer games.

This app will consist of two activities. The main activity will include a `RecyclerView` where the items are names of host cities from around the world along with checkboxes that the user can check when they have seen an item.

Clicking on the name of a host city will take the user to a detail activity
that shows the extra details about the particular games they hosted along with a button to view the Wikipedia entry for the city. Pressing back from the detail activity takes the user back
to the main activity. See examples below.

The instructor has Android devices with a sample solution installed. You can ask to briefly borrow one of these devices to see the intended functionality.

## Skeleton Code

You have been provided with skeleton code. The structure of the app
will be familiar to you from previous labs.

* `City` represents a city
  * Although there are no optional properties in the class new objects are created using the Builder pattern which helps to set immutability for the class data
  * As a result only getter methods to retrieve the course title and description are provided

* `JsonUtils` loads the details from the JSON assets file
  * The app will make use of the contents included in an included asset file

* `DetailActivity` corresponds to the second screenshot above, displaying information about a specific host city
  * It doesn't do much yet as you will be completing it

* `MainActivity.java` will display a list of names of host cities using a ` RecyclerView`
  * When the name of a city is clicked `DetailActivity` will be launched via an explicit `Intent`
  * `MainActivity` will use `SharedPreferences` to store information about which cities the user has visited
    * For example, in the screenshot for `MainActivity` the user has visited Adams
    Lake and Amelia Lake
    * For the `SharedPreferences` the keys will be olympic games number associated with a host city and the values will be booleans
      * True representing that a user has visited a city and false representing that a user has not
      * If an id is not found in the `SharedPreferences` its value will be assumed to be false.

## Todo

Complete the TODOs in `MainActivity.java` and `DetailActivity.java`.

Note that there are also TODOs related to the `SharedPreferences` which are labeled as `TODO: SharedPreferences`. I recommend you do the other TODOs first and then come back to these ones.

**You may only modify `MainActivity.java` and `DetailActivity.java`. You must not make changes to any other
files.**

If you think you need to modify any other file, ask the
instructor or TA.

## Hints

Here are links to some documentation that might be helpful. All of
these, except for the `AsyncTask` documentation, are also included
in the skeleton at the point where they might be helpful.

## Deliverables

When you are done, submit `MainActivity.java` and `DetailActivity.java` to the LabExam Dropbox folder on D2L.

You can find these files in the directory at this relative path: `LabExamSkeleton/app/src/main/java/mobiledev/unb/ca/labexam/`


## Final Words

Good luck, and have fun!

If you get stuck ask a question. This is an exam so the instructor and TA can only provide limited answers. However, depending on the nature of the problem they might be able to help.

In any case submit your best effort. Your code will be read when it is marked, so it is possible to do well on this exam even if your code does not run correctly.
