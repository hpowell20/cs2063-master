# LocationDemo

An app that requests the device's last known location based on this
documentation:
http://developer.android.com/training/location/retrieve-current.html

This app targets API level 23, and so uses the new permissions model
for API level 23 in which permissions are granted by the user at
run-time, instead of when the app is installed. More details on this
new permissions model are here:
http://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html
