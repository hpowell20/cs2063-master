# MapDemo

A sample app that displays a map and a single location. This is based
on the app that is created if you chose to create a new project with a
"Google Maps Activity" in AndroidStudio (with very little
modification).

Note that in order to run this you must get an Google Maps Android API
key from here:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/ You then
need to add this key to ```AndroidManifest.xml``` where indicated.
