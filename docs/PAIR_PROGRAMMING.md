# Pair Programming

Pair programming has many benefits in software development, CS education, and particularly learning mobile application development (Seyam and McCrickard, 2016). In this lab, we will try pair programming. You must work in pairs. You can work with anybody of your choosing. (You will probably benefit most if you work with someone other than your partner for the course project, but that's not a
requirement today.)

One of you will be the "driver"; the other will be the "navigator". The driver types at the computer, while the navigator reviews what is being written and watches for mistakes. Every 15 minutes, the driver and navigator should switch roles.

In a common model of pair programming the driver and navigator use a single computer. Today we won't be quite so strict. The driver and navigator will use a single instance of AndroidStudio, but can use multiple computers (e.g., you might want AndroidStudio open on one lab machine, and a browser with documentation on another).
