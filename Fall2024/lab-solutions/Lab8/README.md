Compose differs from what we have seen as it makes use of Compostable items which are treated like components

You will notice that there are no layout files.  Compose makes use of a folder called ui.theme.  The intention is to have developers use native Kotin for managing the UI elements as opposed to XML - To be confirmed.  Inside this folder there are the following files:
* Color.kt
* Shape.kt
* Theme.kt
* Type.kt
