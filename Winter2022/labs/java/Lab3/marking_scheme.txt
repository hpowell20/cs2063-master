Writeup (3 marks):

Part 1 - Something to the extent that activities keep getting added and removed from the stack
This differs from Lab 2 as the back button was being used to go back as opposed to continually adding to the back stack
Part 2 - The implementation can be adjusted to use ExternalActivityCalls.this.finish(); (this behaves like the back button by destroying the activity)
Part 3 - Include screenshot
